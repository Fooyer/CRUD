# CRUD system

CRUD system is a "CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE" system.

I use phpmyadmin database connection, but you can use any database server(SQL and Apache).

On "mysql" file is the code for create the database and tables for the system.

THIS IS A TEST CODE (my first "complete" code using PHP)
